# Hello World!

Hey! This is the first post on this blog, and I decided it's going to be about the blog itself.

## This blog's technical stack
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) framework.
- [Python Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) library.
- Markdown (for the posts themselves)
- [Skeleton CSS](https://getskeleton.com) boilerplate and some custom CSS for the styling.

Here's a test of how code looks like:
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello world!")
```
## Why I built this
I wanted to make a blog to share stories behind my projects, difficulties I faced and what motivated me to finish/keep maintaining them. Basically: a place to share my feelings about my projects if you will.
